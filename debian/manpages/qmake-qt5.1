.TH QMAKE 1 "2017-04-09" "The Qt Company Ltd."
.SH NAME
qmake \- cross-platform makefile generator for Qt

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qmake
.I "[mode] [options] [files]"
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B QMake
has two modes, one mode for generating project files based on some
heuristics, and the other for generating makefiles. Normally you
shouldn't need to specify a mode, as makefile generation is the default
mode for qmake, but you may use this to test qmake on an existing
project.

.SH MODE
.TP
.B "\-project"
Put qmake into project file generation mode. In this mode qmake
interprets files as files to be built, defaults to *.c; *.ui; *.y; *.l;
*.ts; *.xlf; *.qrc; *.h; *.hpp; *.hh; *.hxx; *.H; *.cpp; *.cc; *.cxx; *.C.
.TP
.B "\-makefile"
Put qmake into makefile generation mode (default). In this mode qmake
interprets files as project files to be processed, if skipped qmake will
try to find a project file in your current working directory.
